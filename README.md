How to compile and run this program:
1.Run the "gcc prime.c -o prime.o" command to complie the prime file
2.Run the "rrScheduler.c -o rrScheduler.o" command to complie the rrSchedule file
3.Run "./rrScheduler.o input.txt" to start the scheduler



Program Limitatons:
We belive this program completey fufills all of the requirements set for assignment 2.
This program successfully takes in and processes a input file and runs a round robin style
scheduler. The program iterates through each process and tracks each 10 second interval 
including how much time each process has left before it is complete.
